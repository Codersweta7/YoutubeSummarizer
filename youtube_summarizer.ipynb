            "Hello Everyone! I'm Santi and I'mcurrently working as an Ml engineer Um Iremember When I was first starting out, Ialways saw that all the videos and allthe blogs, they suggested to use Jupyternotebook and I always found it verydifficult to use Jupyter Notebook andlike almost always Jup notebooks are theway to go And it is true. Um, any kind ofalgorithms you want to experiment withyou want to train any kind of algorithmor you just want to analyze some dataand understand how things are workingyou do not want to execute the scriptagain and again in Vs code the entirescript. You want to save the variablesand you want to experiment with them indifferent other algorithms again andagain for comparison and so on. So thatis why today in this video, I'll betalking about how you can, um, downloadand use Jupyter Notebook in just fivesteps. So let's start the timer. I'll talkabout it in less than 2 minutes. firstI'll talk about how you can do that inMac OS Okay, Okay, so the timer hasstarted. Let's go first. You need tosearch online. How to installBrew Go to the official website and youwill see this and then copy this commandnow go to terminal and go inside thepreferred folder and then paste thiscommand. This will ask for your passwordput in yourpassword and this will install home brewI already have Brew installed so it willnot give me it, will not install it againbut if you're in installing it for thefirst time, then you will have to addblue to your path. So you will see twocommands at the end of this messageearlier and these will be the twocommands in case you don't see them. Andthen you can copy these out and um, runit in your terminal to add Brew to yourpath. Now the next thing that comes isinstall Python. So I already have itinstalled so it will not install itagain. But in your case, it will installit If you're doing it for the first timenext thing comes is making a directorylet's make a directory for our purposeswhere you want to basically do thisproject Um, then what you'll do is make avirtual environment. This is veryimportant because this will help you tokeep your Global installation and yourlocal installation separate. So now whatyou'll do is be/ activate Now you'vegone inside your virtual environmenthere whatever installations that you dothere are lot of Version Controlproblems all the time. So in order toavoid them, keep your Global and localinstallations, keep the installations forevery folder every project separateinside a different virtual environmentthen you will never face this problemever next comes just simply do Jupiterinstall it'll install Jupiter I alreadyhave it installed. But in your case, ifyou're doing it for the first time, it'llinstall it now. Simple thing: just dojupyter notebook in your terminal andthen you have your jupter notebookrunning. Yeah, There you go. You have yourjupter notebook runningjust yeah here. Okay, now comes thejupyter installation for Windows Firstyou will need to download Python. If youdon't have Python already installed, youwill download it here. Go to the officialwebsite download whatever version suitsyou always better to download the latesttable version and then go through allthe Um commands always check in thething that says add Python to your paththat's very important. You can go to likemake a directory where you want to storethis let's say it'stutorial Then go insidetutorial. Great! Now comes. Uh, Make thethat I said earlier. You need to make thevirtual environment. It's very importantto have a virtual environment becausethis will keep your local and Globalinstallation separate. Um, There are oftenmany Version Control problems that onefaces when you are like working withdifferent projects. So it's best to doevery project in a separate virtualenvironment. Um, to prevent any kind ofproblems in thefuture. Okay, so now um, as this is doneoften, the next thing that you need to doisbasicallyum do slash Scripts slash um activatethis will activate your um, the virtualenvironment that you have Now there'sone thing that I was facing earliersometimes people face that since I'vealready done it before so that is whyI'm not facing it Now you need to dothis one. Basically you will get an UNRyou will get a restricted access and youtry to run a script on this system. Soyou can do this andthen um, this will basically done thiscommand and this will basically giveunderaccess to the user who is using the umproject. Currently, there's one more thinghere if you do not have Pip installedthen you can do this to installpip I already have Pip installed. so Ithink it'll just upgrade that. But if youdo not have it installed and this is theeasiest way to install pip And as soonas you have Pip installed, then the nextstep that you can do is basicallyinstallJupiter P installJupiter Yeah! so I have this Jupiternotebook installed now. Simply do Jupiternotebook and this will start the Jupyternotebook here and you cansimply write a new function, Write a newnotebook. Okay, I think that's all fortodaystay tuned for next Videos.\n"
